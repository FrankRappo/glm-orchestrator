# GLM/ZCode orchestration backend

This backend runs headless GLM workers under tmux. It has no Claude runtime
dependency. Codex, GLM itself, or a human can own the queue; ownership is
recorded and protected by one controller lock.

## Components

- `glm-linux-wrapper.template.sh` — native Linux CLI wrapper for the official
  ZCode `.deb`; root launches are dropped to the configured regular user.
- `glm_controller.template.sh` — asks GLM to decompose one goal into `T*.md`
  task files, then starts the queue.
- `glm_orchestrator.template.sh` — dynamic task discovery, bounded parallelism,
  resource locks, model routing, quota admission, terminal reports.
- `glm_supervisor.template.sh` — retries, runtime deadline, quota waits,
  authentication/configuration quarantine.
- `glm_agent_launcher.template.sh` — isolated model selection and one headless
  `glm --prompt` call.
- `task_metadata.py` and `model_policy.json` — validated per-task routing.
- `glm_runtime_doctor.template.sh` — static and optional live model check.

Use the common entrypoint rather than calling these scripts directly:

```bash
bash /work/glm/common/orchestrate.template.sh doctor --live
bash /work/glm/common/orchestrate.template.sh limits
bash /work/glm/common/orchestrate.template.sh limits --json
bash /work/glm/common/orchestrate.template.sh usage --project /work/myproject
```

The same commands can be entered from Windows through WSL:

```powershell
wsl.exe -d Ubuntu-24.04 -u agentuser -- orchestrate limits
wsl.exe -d Ubuntu-24.04 -u agentuser -- orchestrate usage --project /work/myproject
```

Always pass Linux paths (`/work/...`), not `\\wsl.localhost\...`, to the
orchestrator.

If the live doctor asks for authentication, complete the standalone CLI OAuth
once. Desktop login and CLI login can be separate:

```bash
glm login
```

Run the Linux CLI as a regular user so OAuth and plugin state live under that
user's `~/.zcode`. For a native Linux/WSL installation use
`GLM_PATH_STYLE=native` (the default). Only Windows-interoperability wrappers
should set `GLM_PATH_STYLE=windows`.

The default provider is `account:zai-individual-coding-plan`, which uses the
connected personal Lite/Pro/Max plan. The orchestrator never reads or copies the
credential file into task prompts or logs. The quota helper decrypts credentials
only in memory to query the official quota endpoints and emits normalized usage
without secrets.

`orchestrate limits` shows both `used` and `remaining_pct` for every quota bucket,
including the shared five-hour and weekly Coding Plan pools, alongside the raw
remaining/limit values. `limits --json` includes `remaining_percent` (or `null`
when the limit is zero). Remaining percent is computed from the provider's
remaining amount, so it can differ slightly from `100 - used_percent` when the
provider rounds its used-percent figure.

## GLM controls the run

```bash
cat > /work/myproject/GOAL.md <<'EOF'
Implement the requested feature, add regression tests, and verify the build.
EOF

bash /work/glm/common/orchestrate.template.sh start \
  --project /work/myproject \
  --controller glm \
  --goal /work/myproject/GOAL.md \
  --max-parallel 2 \
  --quota-policy enforce
```

GLM first creates bounded `tasks/T*.md` files, then the same queue starts GLM
workers for them.

## Codex controls the run

Codex writes the tasks from `task.template.md`, then starts the queue with its
ownership recorded:

```bash
bash /work/glm/common/orchestrate.template.sh start \
  --project /work/myproject \
  --controller codex \
  --max-parallel 2 \
  --quota-policy enforce
```

`controller=codex` does not launch another Codex process. It means the current
Codex session owns planning, task authoring, steering, review, and integration;
GLM sessions execute the task files.

## Task routing

Supported headers:

```text
Complexity: low | medium | high | critical
Model: auto | GLM-5.3 | GLM-5.3-Flash | GLM-5.2 | GLM-5-Turbo
Mode: build | edit | plan | yolo
Resource-Lock: none | <name>
No-Respawn: true | false
Max-Respawn: 3
Max-Runtime-Seconds: 7200
```

Autonomous headless tasks should use `Mode: yolo`. ZCode's `build` and `edit`
modes expect an interactive permission client; the launcher maps them to
`yolo` by default (`GLM_HEADLESS_AUTO_APPROVE=1`) so unattended workers do not
stall on `No permission client configured`.

Default policy:

| Complexity | Model |
| --- | --- |
| low | GLM-5.3-Flash |
| medium | GLM-5.3 |
| high | GLM-5.3 |
| critical | GLM-5.3 |

Critical work still requires independent review by the owning Codex session or
another explicitly chosen reviewer. Model price alone is not a verification
strategy.

`GLM-5.2` and `GLM-5-Turbo` are accepted as explicit per-task overrides. Auto
routing intentionally stays on the currently verified 5.3 family.

The planner and workers also default to token-conscious execution: targeted
file reads, concise evidence, focused tests during edits, and required broad
validation at the end. This does not relax acceptance or verification. Low
complexity tasks already route to Flash; medium/high/critical stay on GLM-5.3
to protect quality. Selecting Flash or GLM-5.2 with the default Coding Plan
provider does **not** prove a separate free allowance is being used; check the
actual provider and quota snapshot before claiming savings.

## Runtime status

```bash
bash /work/glm/common/orchestrate.template.sh status --project /work/myproject
bash /work/glm/common/orchestrate.template.sh attach --project /work/myproject
bash /work/glm/common/orchestrate.template.sh stop --project /work/myproject
```

The queue uses exact tmux names and a `flock` controller lock. A second Codex,
GLM, or manual controller cannot silently take ownership of the same state
directory.
